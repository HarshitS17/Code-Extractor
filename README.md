# Code Extractor

A Spring Boot application that extracts code snippets from YouTube video lectures.  
It downloads the video, extracts frames, runs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on each frame, and returns the code found in the video.

---

##  Features

- Download videos from YouTube via URL
- Extract frames from video lectures
- Run OCR to detect and extract code snippets
- Simple web interface and REST API
- Modular design: Java (Spring Boot) backend, Python scripts for video and OCR processing
